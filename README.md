## Open Problems
1. Composite, weighted, scaled entropy does not capture 'emergence'
2. What seems to happen is the end-state is high entropy/white-noise. Even if start with just a few seeds, instead of high entropy, leads to noise.

Two paths:
- a few seeds in low entropy/dead world -> low entropy/live world
- high entropy/dead world -> high entropy/live world 
What do both these end states look like?

## Bugs
1. Best score is not always kept across generations

## Ideas

1. Reduce search space. Limit the space of the rule set; ex, ignore rotations/symetries of bit mask; ie all start/end points are the same.
Ex.  100 is same as 010 and 001?
2. Add more cross-over operations

## Next stages?
1. Create a secondary rule set operating on the grid generated at a higher scale of level0; a different color
