## Ideas

1. Reduce search space. Limit the space of the rule set; ex, ignore rotations/symetries of bit mask; ie all start/end points are the same.
Ex.  100 is same as 010 and 001?
2. Add more cross-over operations

## Next stages?
1. Create a secondary rule set operating on the grid generated at a higher scale of level0; a different color
