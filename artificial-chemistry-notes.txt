More formally, an articial chemistry can be dened by a triple (S, R, A), where S is the set of all possible molecules, R is a set of collision rules representing the interaction
among the molecules, and A is an algorithm describing the reaction vessel or domain and how the rules are applied to the molecules inside the vessel. Both the set of molecules S and the set of reaction rules R can be dened explicitly or implicitly (e.g., by an algorithm or mathematical expression).

S = space of integers, possibly in some range
R = set of mathemtical, bit, and logic operators
A = random combinatorial / genetic evolution

Approaches can be characterized roughly by whether each molecule is treated explicitly or all molecules of one type are represented by a number, their frequency, or concentration.

1. Stochastic molecular collisions
Further parameters such as rate constants, energy, spatial information, or temperature can be introduced into the rules for the chemistry to become more realistic.

Create set of random rules takeing n numbers/binary-strings and produces m numbers/binary-strings; preservation of mass should be kept possibly 
Track it all

genetic evelution fitness functions:
- detect cyles of reactions
- self sustaining reactions
